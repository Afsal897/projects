      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My journey into the world of data science began during my undergraduate years, where I discovered my passion for solving complex problems using data. I started by working on small projects, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, and basic machine learning algorithms. Over time, my skills grew, and I began applying advanced techniques such as deep learning and natural language processing to tackle real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my formal education, I have worked on several personal projects, including partial spoofed audio detection using TensorFlow and supervised learning techniques. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience with various machine learning algorithms and tools, further developing my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
